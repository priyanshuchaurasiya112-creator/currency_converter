**Project Report - Currency Converter**



1\. Introduction

This project is a simple currency converter developed using Python and NumPy.

It allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using a predefined exchange rate

matrix.



2\. Problem Statement

People often need to convert currencies manually, which can lead to mistakes.

This project aims to automate the conversion using Python and NumPy.



3\. Objective

\- a easy Python program for currency conversion.

\- Use NumPy arrays to store and process exchange rates.

\- Practice basics Python concepts.



4\. Functional Requirements

\- User can choose source and target currencies.

\- Convert amount using NumPy rate matrix.

\- Input validation for currency codes and amounts.



5\. Non-functional Requirements

 -this is easy to use

 -it give correct output as per the rate given in array

 -Code is be simple

 -Should handle basic errors properly



6\. code structure

The system contains three main logical parts:

\- User input module

\- Conversion module using NumPy

\- Output module



7.flow of the project

User Input -> Currency Selection => NumPy Conversion => Output Display



8\. Implementation Details

Python functions are used to handle input, validation, and conversion.

NumPy arrays store rates allowing easy indexing.



10\. Challenges occurs

\- Selecting appropriate dummy exchange rates

\- invalid input doesn't take



11.what we learn by this project

\- Practical knowledge of NumPy library

 - Practice of modules of python



12\. Future changes

\- by the help of APi we also added live cunnercy tracking

\- Add GUI using Tkinter

\- add almost all currency



13\. References

\- Python

\- NumPy
